#Feature Branch Workflow
Developers needs to create a new branch before developing the feature.
After committing certain changes to the feature branch, the changes are merged into the central repository.
Then developers file a pull request before merging the changes into the main file, other team members can also contribute into the same file before merging it to the main file.
Then the changes are ready to publish.
